Libraries Used
readxl: For reading Excel files.
dplyr: For data manipulation.
Benchmarking: For performing benchmarking and efficiency analysis.
openxlsx: For writing Excel files.
Data Preparation
Reading Data: Reads the COVID-19 data from the Excel file into the owid_covid_data dataframe.

Selection and Handling Missing Values:

Selects specific columns related to location, dates, and various COVID-19 metrics (vaccinations, tests, cases, deaths) into selected_data.
Removes rows with missing values (na.omit()).
Determining First Dates: Groups data by location and finds the earliest date for each location, storing it in first_dates.

Selecting Last Entry per Location: For each location, selects the latest data entry (last row) based on the date in selected_data.

Merging Data: Merges selected_data with first_dates based on the 'location' column to add the earliest date for each location.

Data Refinement:

Renames columns.
Converts date columns to the appropriate date format.
Calculates the number of days between the start and end dates.
Calculating Daily Metrics: Divides cumulative metrics (vaccinations, tests, cases, deaths) by the number of days to get daily rates.

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
Preparation for DEA:

Prepares input and output variables for DEA analysis (inputs and outputs).
DEA Analysis:

Uses the Benchmarking package to perform Data Envelopment Analysis (dea() function).
The analysis aims to assess efficiency with given inputs and outputs while allowing for slack in the data.
Result Handling:

Stores DEA analysis outcomes (efficiency, slack, lambda) in the outcome dataframe.
Renames columns and binds the 'Country' column.
Writing Results: Writes the outcome dataframe to an Excel file named "model_outcome.xlsx".

Notes:
The code assumes specific column names in the input Excel file and performs operations based on those assumptions.
It conducts DEA to assess efficiency and generates an Excel file with the outcomes.
Remember, if the column names or data structures differ from the assumed format, adjustments might be necessary for the code to function correctly with other datasets.
